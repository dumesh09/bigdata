# Evaluation

We tried regression model based on geography,industry,job_family and overall to analyse the impact of covid-19 on the job market.
Evaluation shows improvent in the job market. We considered month vise variation in the data in different catogories. 

- our linear regression model gives us an accuracy of 71.2%

# Optimization

- We can further optimize our analysis by using multiple regression model.
- In the begininning it may shows signs of over-fitting.
- Once the model is tuned it will give better accuracy.
