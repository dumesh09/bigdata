As you can see in the above data, Entertainment and Recreation,
Hospitality Staff and Sales have seen a huge rise in US job listings in
the last 3 months (as much as x20 times the pre-covid levels). Even the
other job families have also seen a rise such as IT, Healthcare and
Finance/Insurance the increase is much more modest (2x-3x times). This
is a positive sign that businesses are opening up and are looking to
hire talent.

Next, we evaluate how covid has impacted jobs across different
geographies:

Ohio, South Dakota, North Dakota, Montana, Maine and Alaska have seen
the most growth in job postings w.r.t to pre-covid levels (\~10x times).
It is slightly surprising to see that California, Louisiana, and
Washington have not seen such a rise in job postings and in fact job
postings have reduced in Louisiana.

recover in Q4 2020, but then the second wave of COVID came and finally
now we can see a recovery trend in almost all the industries (hence it
looks sustainable).

According to the data, the job market seems to be improving by the
number of job postings reaching almost (x4 times) the March, 2020
(pre-covid) levels. This may be due to the fact that most of the people
are vaccinated now and are taking precautions such as masks and social
distancing. Therefore, if you are looking for a change or are entering
the job market right now it is the a good time.
